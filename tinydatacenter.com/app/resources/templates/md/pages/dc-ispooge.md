This DC has carried the ispooge site for a while. It's within TinyDC and getting
the mobile [Analog Zen](/dc-analogzen.html) as a sattelite soon. This is a nebulous
one to be called a DC in itself, but since it's not tied to its parent and can
be carried away and has additional functionality, it's its own thing.

In the past couple weeks it's been the host for the iSpooge Daily live stream
(and annoying stream testing). It's good for that purpose but it's for better or
worse also turned into the main development box I'd been using. I'd perhaps expand
the tinkerboard used for [Boob](/dc-boob.html) into the mix but since I switched 
iSpooge for Boob they don't both have a place as of yet. The t-board will probably
be used for compilation and things of that nature, since it has 2G ram and is fast.
