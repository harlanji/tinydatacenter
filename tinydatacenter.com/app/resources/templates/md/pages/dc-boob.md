Boob is used for YouTube, BitChute, and DTube watching... as well as monitoring 
the iSpooge Daily live stream and reading various news. It's hooked up to the TV
in the kitchen/living room (SF studio)... the TV is old, not smart, but works well.

I sofar don't use BlueTooth, being old fashioned I get up to change the video. I
share the keyboard with other machines, so it's carried away by day and often 
cleaned up before bed.
