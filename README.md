# TinyDataCenter

This repo is mean to be cloned onto a new RasPi or supported SBC to help with application creation,
operations, and perhaps more. 



## How to use this repo


This is a work in progress. It's designed for people with no computing experience and a teacher.
It intentionally avoids some of the common "industry grade" practices, with the understanding 
that those will come in later stages. Instead it focuses on creating a small application that
works as the soverign master copy, aka. origin, that feeds into scalable cloud services.
For example a small business owner may tinker with an inexpensive SBC to build a working concept
that functions until they can hire a pragmatic engineer to take over the project.

The respository can be well understood by reading the history of short commit messages for a
project of interest. The TinyDataCenter website contains pages with principles that are used.
In short, a person comfortable working in an auto garage should be comfortable with this project.

See the [website](https://tinydatacenter.com) for more detailed info--source contained within
this repository as well, so it can be built and used locally.
