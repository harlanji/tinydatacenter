## Maintanable website

From the baseline maintainable website one is able to carry out a number of more interesting projects.
This episode will focus on porting a simple static website to one with a layout and some pages. We will
use a static site generator to avoid many issues that come with maintaining a website using more technology
that seems less primitive... from my perspective this technique is equally or more advanced than popular
modern tools.

We get security and horizontal scalability out of the box. In a future episode we'll see how to incorporate dynamic
elements into the website. Following our [persistent static website]() design one can imagine how events 
can be utilized for dynamic portions of the website.
