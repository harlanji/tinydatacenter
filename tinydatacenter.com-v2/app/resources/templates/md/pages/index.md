Welcome to Tiny DataCenter. Here you'll find a series of video and text guides that should help you integrate these wonderful devices into your daily computing tasks.

You might get some new ideas. It's very easy to start a business in this new [economic landscape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ef-aF5TCGs&list=PLD5lYPY-uZpoEVzJkgE2ejlSk9uG2TRlP&index=6).

It is built from ARM based single board computers, or SBCs for short (scientifically tinius computerus aka tiny computers). They cost $50-100 USD for most uses, and can be reused by having several spare SD cards on hand (like old bootable floppy disks).

Bonus: It uses ARM processors and are [unaffected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtvJ4k8tEBY&list=PLD5lYPY-uZpoEVzJkgE2ejlSk9uG2TRlP&index=9) by the Intel branch prediction bugs!

    Don't forget to ask about our shortest ruler on Amazon special :)
