## Experience

Simple and author intends it to be so. Was impressed by React being included. No
syntax highlight, but font is monospace so itâ€™s acceptable. Serving and exports will
make for interesting jam sessions.

Uncovered ability to download images in the gallery or replace contents in the editor.
Downloaded JS or CSS assets can be attached to the DOM via Javascript or HTML
references. From the same author, seemingly the foundational code base, is an open
source editor called [Editha](https://github.com/tnantoka/edhita) which includes Markdown support and browser preview...
while JSAnywhere itself is not open source, one could imagine a short path to a nice
editor derived from that code base.
