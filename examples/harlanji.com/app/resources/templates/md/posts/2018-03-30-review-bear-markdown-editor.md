## Experience

Writing Have been using for one week. Writing this article using it. Workflow will be to
export markdown, avoid drawing and images for publication. Will use PDF if needed
for that.

Fliers PDF Export makes for simple fliers, like you would see on utility poles for used
driers or missing cats (hyper local). Bands could benefit; screen form factor with stylized
text is interesting.
